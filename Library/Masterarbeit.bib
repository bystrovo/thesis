Music sometimes improves performance in sustained attention tasks. But the type of music employed in previous investigations has varied considerably, which can account for equivocal results. Progress has been hampered by lack of a systematic database of music varying in key characteristics like tempo and valence. The aims of this study were to establish a database of popular music varying along the dimensions of tempo and valence and to examine the impact of music varying along these dimensions on restoring attentional resources following performance of a sustained attention to response task (SART) vigil. Sixty-nine participants rated popular musical selections that varied in valence and tempo to establish a database of four musical types: fast tempo positive valence, fast tempo negative valence, slow tempo positive valence, and slow tempo negative valence. A second group of 89 participants performed two blocks of the SART task interspersed with either no break or a rest break consisting of 1 of the 4 types of music or silence. Presenting positive valence music (particularly of slow tempo) during an intermission between two successive blocks of the SART significantly decreased miss rates relative to negative valence music or silence. Results support an attentional restoration theory of the impact of music on sustained attention, rather than arousal theory and demonstrate a means of restoring sustained attention. Further, the results establish the validity of a music database that will facilitate further investigations of the impact of music on performance.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {It is proposed that games, which are designed to generate positive affect, are most successful when they facilitate flow (Csikszentmihalyi 1992). Flow is a state of concentration, deep enjoyment, and total absorption in an activity. The study of games, and a resulting understanding of flow in games can inform the design of non-leisure software for positive affect. The paper considers the ways in which computer games contravene Nielsen's guidelines for heuristic evaluation (Nielsen and Molich 1990) and how these contraventions impact on flow. The paper also explores the implications for research that stem from the differences between games played on a personal computer and games played on a dedicated console. This research takes important initial steps towards defining how flow in computer games can inform affective design.},

abstract = {This paper explores the roots of human-computer interaction as a discipline, the various trends which have marked its development, and some of the current and future challenges for research. Human-computer interaction, like any vocational discipline, sits upon three broad foundations: theoretical principles, professional practice and a community of people. As an interdisciplinary field the theoretical roots of HCI encompass a number of other disciplines including psychology, computing, ergonomics, and social sciences; however, it also has theoretical and practical challenges of its own. The evolving internal and external context of HCI, computers, have become smaller and less costly; this has led to changes in nature of the users and uses of computers, with corresponding impact on society. The paper explores the current challenges of computers from the cloud to digital fabrication and the need to design for solitude. It suggests that HCI should not just react to the changes around it, but also shape those changes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emotional states linked to arousal and mood are known to affect the efficiency of cognitive performance. However, the extent to which memory processes may be affected by arousal, mood or their interaction is poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Following a study phase of abstract shapes, we altered the emotional state of participants by means of exposure to music that varied in both mood and arousal dimensions, leading to four different emotional states: (i) positive mood-high arousal; (ii) positive mood-low arousal; (iii) negative mood-high arousal; (iv) negative mood-low arousal. Following the emotional induction, participants performed a memory recognition test. Critically, there was an interaction between mood and arousal on recognition performance. Memory was enhanced in the positive mood-high arousal and in the negative mood-low arousal states, relative to the other emotional conditions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Neither mood nor arousal alone but their interaction appears most critical to understanding the emotional enhancement of memory.},

New research on emotion and cognition has shown that attractive things really do work better, as Donald Norman amply demonstrates in this fascinating book, which has garnered acclaim everywhere from Scientific American to The New Yorker. Emotional Design articulates the profound influence of the feelings that objects evoke, from our willingness to spend thousands of dollars on Gucci bags and Rolex watches, to the impact of emotion on the everyday objects of tomorrow. Norman draws on a wealth of examples and the latest scientific insights to present a bold exploration of the objects in our everyday world.

@article{Citron2014,
abstract = {A growing body of literature shows that the emotional content of verbal material affects reading, wherein emotional words are given processing priority compared to neutral words. Human emotions can be conceptualised within a two-dimensional model comprised of emotional valence and arousal (intensity). These variables are at least in part distinct, but recent studies report interactive effects during implicit emotion processing and relate these to stimulus-evoked approach-withdrawal tendencies.The aim of the present study was to explore how valence and arousal interact at the neural level, during implicit emotion word processing. The emotional attributes of written word stimuli were orthogonally manipulated based on behavioural ratings from a corpus of emotion words. Stimuli were presented during an fMRI experiment while 16 participants performed a lexical decision task, which did not require explicit evaluation of a word's emotional content.Results showed greater neural activation within right insular cortex in response to stimuli evoking conflicting approach-withdrawal tendencies (i.e., positive high-arousal and negative low-arousal words) compared to stimuli evoking congruent approach vs. withdrawal tendencies (i.e., positive low-arousal and negative high-arousal words). Further, a significant cluster of activation in the left extra-striate cortex was found in response to emotional than neutral words, suggesting enhanced perceptual processing of emotionally salient stimuli.These findings support an interactive two-dimensional approach to the study of emotion word recognition and suggest that the integration of valence and arousal dimensions recruits a brain region associated with interoception, emotional awareness and sympathetic functions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Witty, commonsensical, and eminently practical, it's one of the best-loved and most recommended books on the subject. Now Steve returns with fresh perspective to reexamine the principles that made Don't Make Me Think a classic–with updated examples and a new chapter on mobile usability. And it's still short, profusely illustrated{\ldots}and best of all–fun to read. If you've read it before, you'll rediscover what made Don't Make Me Think so essential to Web designers and developers around the world. If you've never read it, you'll see why so many people have said it should be required reading for anyone working on Web sites. “After reading it over a couple of hours and putting its ideas to work for the past five years, I can say it has done more to improve my abilities as a Web designer than any other book.” –Jeffrey Zeldman, author of Designing with Web Standards About the Author Steve Krug (pronounced "kroog") is best known as the author of Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, now in its second edition with over 350,000 copies in print. Ten years later, he finally gathered enough energy to write another one: the usability testing handbook Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems. The books were based on the 20+ years he's spent as a usability consultant for a wide variety of clients like Apple, Bloomberg.com, Lexus.com, NPR, the International Monetary Fund, and many others. His consulting firm, Advanced Common Sense ("just me and a few well-placed mirrors") is based in Chestnut Hill, MA.

abstract = {The prospect of ubiquitous computing in everyday life urges us to raise basic design issues pertaining to how we will live with, and not only use, computers. To design for everyday life involves much more than enabling people to accomplish certain tasks more effectively, and therefore, traditional approaches to human-computer interaction that focus on usability are not sufficient. To support critical discussion of, and reflection upon, the design of everyday computational things, both new design philosophies and a richer collection of design examples are needed. This thesis reports on the development of a design philosophy based on investigations of the design space of everyday computational things. Using experimental design, a collection of design examples illustrating how computational things can become integral parts of everyday environments has been developed. These investigations have been centred on: amplification of things and environments using computational technology; different forms of information presen- tation; the use of everyday materials in the design of computational things; and the aesthetics of computational things in use. The specific results are a number of design examples, including support for local interaction, access to digital information using physical objects as tokens, information displays such as the ChatterBox and Informative Art, and examples of Slow Technology. The general results are presented as a design philosophy for everyday computa- tional things. This design philosophy is aimed at design for meaningful presence, rather than efficient use, and states that computa- tional technology is a design material, that time is the central design parameter and that aesthetics is the basis for design for presence.

abstract = {This paper empirically examines the impact of the interactivity elicited by e-learning environments for higher education. By considering the underlying processes of imagery, spatial presence, copresence and flow, we analyse how interactivity affects users' responses towards the learning environment, including their actual continuance behaviour. We validate our conceptual model by using survey and registrar data obtained from 2530 students of an open, distance university in the European Higher Education Area. The results suggest that the interactivity elicited by an e-learning environment unleashes imagery that in turn facilitates spatial presence and copresence as well as flow. Significant paths are also found from interactivity to flow and from flow to e-learner response variables (attitude, intention to continue and actual continuance behaviour). The paper provides a novel account of the presence and flow-enabling mechanisms in e-learning and offers novel knowledge on how higher education institutions can facilitate e-learners' continuance behaviour.},

abstract = {Research in human computer interaction (HCI) covers both technological and human behavioural concerns. As a consequence, the contributions made in HCI research tend to be aware to either engineering or the social sciences. In HCI the purpose of practical research contributions is to reveal unknown insights about human behaviour and its relationship to technology. Practical research methods normally used in HCI include formal experiments, field experiments, field studies, interviews, focus groups, surveys, usability tests, case studies, diary studies, ethnography, contextual inquiry, experience sampling, and automated data collection. In this paper, we report on our experience using the evaluation methods focus groups, surveys and interviews and how we adopted these methods to develop artefacts: either interface's design or information and technological systems. Four projects are examples of the different methods application to gather information about user's wants, habits, practices, concerns and preferences. The goal was to build an understanding of the attitudes and satisfaction of the people who might interact with a technological artefact or information system. Conversely, we intended to design for information systems and technological applications, to promote resilience in organisations (a set of routines that allow to recover from obstacles) and user's experiences. Organisations can here also be viewed within a system approach, which means that the system perturbations even failures could be characterized and improved. The term resilience has been applied to everything from the real estate, to the economy, sports, events, business, psychology, and more. In this study, we highlight that resilience is also made up of a number of different skills and abilities (self-awareness, creating meaning from other experiences, self-efficacy, optimism, and building strong relationships) that are a few foundational ingredients, which people should use along with the process of enhancing an organisation's resilience. Resilience enhances knowledge of resources available to people confronting existing problems.},

The experiments were conducted by introducing two contracting e-learning materials, i.e., the one is characterized as interactive material and the other is non-interactive one. During the experiment physiological sensor, i.e., galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor was attached to the participant. Furthermore, GSR data were extracted by feature generator, LDA. The purpose of feature extraction is to find preferably small number of features that are particularly distinguishing or informative for the classification process and that are invariant to irrelevant transformations of the data. Finally, several classifiers were performed discriminating student attitude towards e-learning course materials response using GSR sensor data. The results showed that discriminant analysis (DA) and support vector machine (SVM) give high accuracy rate, while the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) give moderate accuracy rate.},

abstract = {Abstract Forty college students participated in a study ostensibly designed to obtain measures of the hemispheric activity while they worked on a spatial reasoning task. In fact, our true interest was in determining whether subjects would return to the spatial reasoning task once the hemispheric recordings were completed. Subjects would normally be expected to return to the task by virtue of the Zeigarnik effect because no subject completed the task during the “hemispheric recording” phase. The manipulation involved telling one group of subjects that they would be paid {\$}1.50 for participating in the study (expected reward group). The remainder of the subjects were not led to expect the reward (unexpected reward group). The result was that 86{\%} of the unexpected reward subjects but only 58{\%} of the expected reward subjects (p {\textless} .05) manifested the Zeigarnik effect. This differential tendency to return to the task was further reflected in time differences. The average unexpected reward subject spent 3 min 48 sec of a five‐minute free‐choice period at the task, whereas the average expected reward subject spent only 2 min 20 sec (p {\textless} .05). Reward expectancy, therefore, led to an undermining of the Zeigarnik effect. This observation supports Condry's prediction that rewarding performance at a task can lead to premature task disengagement.},

abstract = {Researchers of human-technology interaction have started to emphasise the importance of technology users' experiences: experience is an important aspect of daily life, and thus it should be taken into account in human-technology interaction research and in design of new technologies. However, scientific study of conscious experience is difficult, and the field of user experience research is afflicted by incompatible definitions, assumptions, and guidelines for investigating users' experiences and designing for them. This problem is emphasised by the lack of foundational framework, which would allow for comparing the metascientific and methodological assumptions behind different accounts of user experience. Here, such an account is presented in the form of foundational analysis of human-technology interaction. The resulting methodological framework is used to review theories of user experience with a conclusion that while the topics investigated under the umbrella of user experience seem to be the correct ones, their operationalisation lacks proper psychological basis. As a result of the foundational analysis of user experience, one of the core concepts related to conscious experience, emotion, is introduced, and different psychological accounts for it are reviewed using the methodological framework. Appraisal theory of emotion is shown to provide methodologically the best op- tion for studying emotional user experience. A review of empirical studies, in- cluded as the articles of this thesis, supports this conclusion. Emotional user experience is discussed in terms of (1) a competence-frustration model, (2) indi- vidual coping differences in human-technology interaction, (3) mental contents of emotional experience, and (4) the non-conscious cognitive processes associat- ed with the appraisal process. These elaborations can be used to investigate what users experience emotionally when they interact with technology, and explain these experiences. Such investigations should provide valid knowledge structures for designers, who aim to create technologies with certain experience goals. Keywords:},

abstract = {Theory predicts that animals in adverse conditions can decrease individual risks and increase long-term benefits by cooperating with neighbours. However, some empirical studies suggest that animals often focus on short-term benefits, which can reduce the likelihood that they will cooperate with others. In this experimental study, we tested between these two alternatives by evaluating whether increased predation risk (as a correlate of environmental adversity) enhances or diminishes the occurrence of cooperation in mobbing, a common anti-predator behaviour, among breeding pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca. We tested whether birds would join their mobbing neighbours more often and harass a stuffed predator placed near their neighbours' nests more intensely in areas with a higher perceived risk of predation. Our results show that birds attended mobs initiated by their neighbours more often, approached the stuffed predator significantly more closely, and mobbed it at a higher intensity in areas where the perceived risk of predation was experimentally increased. In such high-risk areas, birds also were more often involved in between-pair cooperation. This study demonstrates the positive impact of predation risk on cooperation in breeding songbirds, which might help in explaining the emergence and evolution of cooperation.},

Surprisingly however, socio-affective skills of victimized and bullying children have only rarely been the subject of investigation. In this study, the emotion understanding of Swiss kindergarten children between the ages of four and seven years was probed with the Test of Emotion Comprehension (TEC) and an emotion recognition task. Individual scores in victimization and bullying behavior were determined using teacher ratings. Ordinal regression analyses showed that problems in recognizing mimic emotions (specifically anger, sadness and fear), understanding external causes of emotions and understanding the possibility of hiding emotions were predictive of more victimization. Likewise, problems in understanding external causes of emotions were related to more bullying behavior. Implications of these results for the prevention of bullying are discussed.},

E-Learning is an emerging methodology of modern education. It is growing very fast for last two decades in the education sector. All the university's, schools and companies started offering online courses to satisfy the student needs, and to improve employee effectiveness. E-Learning can deliver more value at very less cost than any other traditional mode of education. This advantage is attached with high-operating leverage for e-Learning companies, should translate them into elevated margins and returns on capital in the industry. E-Learning provides more advantage and user friendly even though it has disadvantages. There are many issues that remain still to be resolved including challenges in assessment, plagiarism and high drop-out rates at E-Learning. It provided classes likes recorded lectures, E-Books, Blogs, Wikis etc. But it's not focused on the learner's perception. On considering these issues it is forward for research which is discussed as further. By the way the course will be getting more effective in psychological perceptive of learner and it will create an effective learning process.

abstract = {Learner's motivation is one of the main aspects that need to be addressed for a successful learning process. Consequently, learner motivation assessment and measurement have attracted significant research interest in the e-learning area in general and game-based learning in particular. Traditional methodologies for learner motivation analysis rely on data collected through questionnaires. However, this approach does not fit well in the context of game-based learning, because an out-of-game questionnaire breaks the game user's flow and immersion. This paper presents a novel electroencephalography (EEG) sensor-based methodology that supports real-time non-disturbing automatic measurement and analysis of learner's motivation in game-based learning.An evaluation case study with participants playing an educational game was conducted in order to investigate the feasibility of the proposed sensor-based methodology and to compare the proposed methodology with the intrinsic motivation inventory-based questionnaire methodology. The results analysis has shown that the sensor-based methodology outperforms the traditional questionnaire-based methodology. The traditional questionnaire-based methodology is limited to analysing learner's motivation on short game-playing durations, while losing its feasibility when analysing learner's overall motivation over a long game-playing duration. Results have shown that learner's motivation changes in time during the game-play period and the learner's self-report of his/her motivation, assessed through the questionnaire-based methodology, tends to reflect only the last moments before the questionnaire is answered. Conversely, the proposed EEG sensor-based methodology is more suitable to analyse learner's motivation on both short and long game-playing durations (e.g. game tasks, game levels, etc.), with the additional benefit of not interrupting the game-play and not breaking the game flow and the learner's immersion with the game. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author 2014.

Studies using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) have shown that symmetry is associated with positive valence words (e.g. love), and random with negative valence words (e.g. hate). Valence is an important aspect of emotion, but equally interesting is the relationship between the symmetry{\'{E}}??random dimension and the dimensions of arousal and complexity. Possible links have long been discussed but empirical evidence is limited. Using a series of four IAT experiments, we report that participants implicitly associate symmetrical patterns with words high in arousal, and random patterns with low arousal. We also found that symmetrical patterns were associated with simple mathematic expressions, while random patterns were associated with complex expressions. No link was found for another aspect of mathematical complexity (smaller or larger numbers). This pattern of results shows that aesthetic responses to symmetry involve both positive valence and high arousal and that these emotional responses arise from the perceptual simplicity of symmetry, in line with the fluency account of aesthetics.},

@article{Eich1989,
abstract = {Events that originate through internal mental operations such as reasoning, imagination, and thought may be more colored by or connected to one's current mood than are those that emanate from external sources. If so, then a shift in mood state, between the occasions of event encoding and event retrieval, should have a greater adverse impact on one's memory for internal than for external events. To investigate this inference, a series of studies was conducted that relied on a continuous music technique to modify mood, and on the generate/read procedures devised by N. J. Slamecka and P. Graf (see record 1980-20399-001) to distinguish internal from external events. Considered collectively, the results suggest that internal events are less likely than external events to be recalled after a shift in mood state. Discussion centers on both the empirical limitations and theoretical implications of the present result, as well as on prospects for future research.},

abstract = {This article reviews evidence indicating that, in most circumstances, positive affect enhances problem solving and decision making, leading to cognitive processing that is not only flexible, innovative, and creative, but also thorough and efficient. These results have implications regarding consumers' potential reactions to affect generated by ads, products, consumption situations, and service encounters. These cognitive effects of positive affect are considered in the context of effects on social interaction that show that positive affect leads to helping, generosity, and interpersonal understanding. Together, these findings suggest implications especially for customer satisfaction, and particularly for a role for employee positive affect, or employee satisfaction, in generating customer satisfaction. Moreover, studies specifically in the domain of medical decision making and problem solving indicate that these implications would apply to the specific areas of doctor–patient interaction, medical decision making, and medical consumer satisfaction. Finally, it is suggested that the benefits of positive affect be considered when formulating healthcare policy and be included in economic models and policy decisions more generally as well.},

@article{Dolcos2004,
abstract = {Prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity associated with emotional evaluation and subsequent memory was investigated with event-related functional MRI (fMRI). Participants were scanned while rating the pleasantness of emotionally positive, negative, and neutral pictures, and memory for the pictures was tested after scanning. Emotional evaluation was measured by comparing activity during the picture rating task relative to baseline, and successful encoding was measured by comparing activity for subsequently remembered versus forgotten pictures (Dm effect). The effect of arousal on these measures was indicated by greater activity for both positive and negative pictures than for neutral ones, and the effect of valence was indicated by differences in activity between positive and negative pictures. The study yielded three main results. First, consistent with the valence hypothesis, specific regions in left dorsolateral PFC were more activated for positive than for negative picture evaluation, whereas regions in right ventrolateral PFC showed the converse pattern. Second, dorsomedial PFC activity was sensitive to emotional arousal, whereas ventromedial PFC activity was sensitive to positive valence, consistent with evidence linking these regions, respectively, to emotional processing and self-awareness or appetitive behavior. Finally, successful encoding (Dm) activity in left ventrolateral and dorsolateral PFC was greater for arousing than for neutral pictures. This finding suggests that the enhancing effect of emotion on memory formation is partly due to an augmentation of PFC-mediated strategic, semantic, and working memory operations. These results underscore the critical role of PFC in emotional evaluation and memory, and disentangle the effects of arousal and valence across PFC regions associated with different cognitive functions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Makatura1999,
abstract = {Although ecological validity of traditional tests of memory has been questioned, use of these tests remains the standard in clinical practice. More recently, however, standardized measures with more emphasis on ecological relevance have been developed. One hundred and nineteen adults with diagnosed brain injuries completed traditional instruments of memory assessment, the Luria Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery Memory Scale (LNNB-M) and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R). Subjects also completed the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT), an instrument designed to measure everyday memory. Additionally, clinicians rated subjects' day-to-day memory functioning at the rehabilitation facility. Results suggest that RBMT is most accurate in classifying severity of memory impairment as rated by clinicians. The LNNB-M and WMS-R were relatively accurate at classifying severely impaired and unimpaired subjects, but were much less accurate at classifying subjects in the mild and moderate impairment ranges. Implications for interpretation and use of these instruments in rehabilitation settings are discussed.},

@article{Thayer1994,
abstract = {Four studies evaluated the success of behaviors and strategies used to self-regulate bad moods, raise energy, and reduce tension. Study 1 (N = 102) used an open-ended questionnaire to identify behavioral categories. Studies 2 and 4 surveyed a representative sample (N = 308) with a fixed-response questionnaire to quantify behaviors, general strategies, and individual differences. Study 3 used psychotherapist (N = 26) judgments of the likely success of the strategies. Therapist and self-rating converged on success of strategies and gender differences. These studies clarify and confirm previous research findings, particularly gender differences in controlling depression. Exercise appears to be the most effective mood-regulating behavior, and the best general strategy to change a bad mood is a combination of relaxation, stress management, cognitive, and exercise techniques. Results support a 2-dimensional biopsychological model of mood.},

@book{Johnson2010,
abstract = {User interface (UI) design rules and guidelines, developed by early HCI gurus and recognized throughout the field, were based on cognitive psychology (study of mental processes such as problem solving, memory, and language), and early practitioners were well informed of its tenants. But today, practitioners with backgrounds in cognitive psychology are a minority, as user interface designers and developers enter the field from a wide array of disciplines. HCI practitioners today have enough experience in UI design that they have been exposed to UI design rules, but it is essential that they understand the psychological basis behind the rules in order to effectively apply them.Jeff Johnson, the author of Morgan Kaufmann's successful GUI Bloopers presents the first practical guide to help designers and developers understand the psychology behind these tried and tested user interface design rules.Johnson applies his engaging, often humorous style--already well known to designers and developers--to describe, in practical terms, the psychological basis for each rule, the value of understanding the reasons for each rule, how they interact in actual systems, and the tradeoffs designers have to make when confronted with conflicting rules or with tight budgets and deadlines.Johnson is not attempting to redefine rules--he is simply taking the existing rules and presenting them in a practical way for current practitioners who either do not have a background in psychology or took the classes so long ago, the fundamentals have faded--tantamount to if you learn a language but don't practice it, the nuances fade.The book will explain what interactive system designers and usability testers need to know about human perception and cognition. It will give designers just enough of a background in psychology that user-interface design guidelines make intuitive sense rather than being just a list of rules to learn and follow.* The first practical, all-in-one source for practitioners on user interface design rules and why, when and how to apply them.* Provides just enough background into the reasoning behind interface design rules that practitioners can make informed decisions in every project.* Gives practitioners the insight they need to make educated design decisions when confronted with tradeoffs, including competing design rules, time constrictions, or limited resources.},
