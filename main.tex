\maketitle
 
I like to ride my bicycle, but only when it is sunny and warm. 
Does this make me a ``fair weather rider''?
If so, so be it.
 
Each morning, I drink a cup of coffee and eat a piece of bread.
Quite a bit of bread is consumed in my household.
Fortunately, I have learned to make bread -- two or three times per week, I bake bread!
